    text: '<p>Added falling snowflakes animation! Created a new Snowflakes component with 50 randomly generated snowflakes that fall across the screen with varying sizes, speeds, and drift patterns. The snowflakes have a soft glow effect and adapt to light/dark themes - light blue on light backgrounds and white with glow on dark backgrounds. Happy holidays!</p><p>PR: <a href="https://github.com/Justbeingjustin/ticket-board/pull/1">https://github.com/Justbeingjustin/ticket-board/pull/1</a></p><img src="/snowflakes-feature.png" alt="Snowflakes falling on the kanban board" />'
