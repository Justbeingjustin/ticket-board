      <p>Redesigned the title section in the ticket modal for a cleaner, more
      intuitive editing experience:</p><ul><li>Removed the "Title" label - the
      input now looks like a native heading</li><li>Made the title larger (2xl)
      and bolder for prominence</li><li>Transparent/borderless input that feels
      like direct text editing</li><li>Moved the ticket ID to a small badge
      above the title</li><li>Changed "Copy" to subtle "Copy ID" text
      link</li></ul><p>The title now looks and feels like editing a document
      heading in Notion or Linear.</p><img src="/improved-title-modal.png"

<p>I dislike how the title looks and can be edited in the ticket modal. I want to be able to edit it easily. dislike how it looks now.</p>
