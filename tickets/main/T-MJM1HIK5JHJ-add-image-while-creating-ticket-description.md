      <p>Replaced the plain Textarea with the RichTextEditor component in
      create-ticket-modal.tsx. The Description field now has a rich text toolbar
      with Bold, Italic, Heading, Lists, Quote, Image button, and Undo/Redo.
      Users can click the image icon to upload images or paste images
      directly.</p><img src="/create-ticket-with-image-support.png" alt="Create
      ticket modal with rich text editor and image support" />
