      <p>Redesigned the ticket detail modal with the following
      improvements:</p><ul><li><strong>Title prominence</strong>: Added a clear
      "Title" label with the ticket ID displayed in a compact
      badge</li><li><strong>No more ALL CAPS</strong>: Changed labels from
      uppercase to sentence case (Status, Priority, Assignee,
      Description)</li><li><strong>Wider modal</strong>: Increased from
      max-w-3xl to max-w-4xl for more breathing room</li><li><strong>Better
      comment placeholder</strong>: Changed to "Write a comment..." and improved
      styling</li><li><strong>Horizontal send button</strong>: Replaced the tall
      squished button with a proper "Send Comment"
      button</li><li><strong>Improved visual hierarchy</strong>: Better spacing,
      grouping, and visual differentiation</li><li><strong>Keyboard
      hint</strong>: Added styled Ctrl+Enter hint with keyboard-style
      badges</li></ul><img src="/modal-redesigned.png" alt="Redesigned ticket

<p></p><p>Rethink layout. dislike Title not obvious. dislike all caps. it also feels like not enough width. Also placeholder for comments feels bad. and send button feels squished. Think visual hierarchy and try again.</p><p></p><p></p>
