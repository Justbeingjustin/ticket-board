<p>sometimes after running /work-ticket T-etc<br><br>it creates PR. I merge it main. and then the ticket has new status with image. but after merge on github desktop it just takes files to be discarded then I can pull it in. Come up with a better way  so that it's smoother. Also, feel free to modify cursor command work-ticket if that helps any.</p>
