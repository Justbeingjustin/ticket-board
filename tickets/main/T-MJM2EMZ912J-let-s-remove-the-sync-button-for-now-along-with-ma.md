      <p>Removed the sync button, refresh button, and "unsaved" badge from the
      git controls header. The header now only shows the branch name with
      ahead/behind indicators.</p><img src="/remove-sync-refresh-unsaved.png"
      alt="Screenshot showing the simplified git controls with only branch name"
